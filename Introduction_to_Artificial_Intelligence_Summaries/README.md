# 📘 IBM Generative AI Engineering — Course 1 Study Guide

This repository contains my personal study guide for **Course 1 of IBM's Generative AI Engineering specialization**.  
The guide is a **50‑page PDF** summarizing every lecture and lab, designed to turn passive learning into an active, reusable resource.

## 🔹 Overview
- Summarized all video lectures and labs into structured notes
- Covered fundamentals of Generative AI, prompt engineering, and applications
- Documented key takeaways, definitions, and workflows
- Created a resource for quick reference and knowledge sharing

## 🔹 Why This Matters
Instead of just completing the course, I actively documented the content to:
- Reinforce my own understanding
- Build a resource for peers and future learners
- Demonstrate my approach: **learn deeply, document clearly, share openly**
